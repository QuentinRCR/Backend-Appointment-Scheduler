## Description
### Goal
The goal of this project is to create the backend of an appointment scheduler.

### How to use it?
This project is a Spring Boot application using gradle. To launch it, go on the root folder and use:
```
gradle bootRun
```
Then, on your web browser, go to `localhost:8080/`. You will be prompted to enter a login and a password. By default, the user `user@gmail.com` with the password `string` is created. You can then test the API by going to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/.

### What is it doing
This project is the backend of an appointment scheduler. It deploys a REST API (by default on `localhost/8080`). It contains:
- Spring security with a registration API that asks for confirmation by email when a new account is created.
- A time-slot manager API that allows to **create**/**modify**/**delete**/**modify**/**find by id**/**find all** time-slots in which clients can make appointments.
- An appointment manager API that allows to **create**/**modify**/**delete**/**modify**/**find by id**/**find all**/**find all by client id** appointments made.

This project has different access rights that allow users to access only some API. This feature is not implemented yet.

> :warning: **For create and modification apis**: The default json proposed by swagger is not correct. Please use the formatting returned by the findById method.
